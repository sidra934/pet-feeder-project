A local animal shelter needs a reliable and scalable low-cost feeder that 
would work for cats and dogs through a built-in container that stores dog food in one half and cat food in the other half. 
The feeder should dispense food that has been pre-portioned by the user at a designated time. 
The feeder should also detect whether the pet has consumed the food and the amount of food through two distinct levels of beep sound.
If the system generates three beeps, then it means the pet had consumed the entire food while one beep signifies there is remaining food. 
This mechanism uses a weighting scale system which tracks the weight of the food in the bowl as the pet consumes it. 
Implementing this mechanism focuses on building a low-cost machine which aligns with the goal, hence low-cost components 
like weight sensors and IR sensors to detect the presence of objects is ideal. 


If the machine does not dispense any food when it is supposed to, then it will display red triangle warning sign. 
Upon seeing this warning, users will be responsible for identifying and solving the issue that falls under three categories.
The first category is that there is no food left in the system to dispense, second being a blocked rotate motor, 
and the third category is a broken machine that would need maintenance.
