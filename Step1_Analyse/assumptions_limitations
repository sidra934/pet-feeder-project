The type and amount of pet food required depends on a range of factors, 
including weight, height, age, activity level, breed, species, and any underlying health conditions.
Therefore, one limitation is that cats and dogs require diverse types of food depending on the factors 
stated but the feeder only stores one type of dog and cat food as the logic focuses on single-bowl behaviour. 
For example, one pet diet might consist of dry food while the other consists of wet food. 

Another assumption is that if the budget cost was higher, then programming a smartphone app that connects to
the feeder system via Bluetooth would have been an excellent feature. This system would send notifications 
about the amount of pet food consumed and to manage scheduled feeding time. 
The outcome would be a more flexible, energy efficient, enhanced user experience. 

Thirdly, the machine only feeds one pet at a time, hence users need to schedule feeding time 
exclusively to avoid overlapping. The system is assumed to store only a small set of feeding schedules 
due to hardware constraints and overlaps. Additionally, the higher number of pets feeding schedule is 
dependent on the machine, the more likely the food storage bin needs to be frequently refilled. 
This compromises the efficiency of an automated feeding machine. Lastly, the feeder needs to have 
sufficient access to reliable power supply or battery backup, otherwise, it would fail to operate as intended.
