Overview

This project explains the logic and behaviour of a low-cost automated pet feeder designed for cats and dogs. The feeder dispenses food at scheduled times with pre-set portioned food, monitors food consumption through sensors, and provides alerts if there's an issue. 

Features

- Automate pet feeding based on scheduled timing.
- monitor bowl weight to detect whether pets have finished their food or if food remains.
- alert users with three beeps if the pet has finished their food. 
- alert users with one beep if the pet has not finished their food.
- alert users with a warning signal if food storage is low or dispensing fails.
