Test no. 3 
In test no.3, the system logic does not account for scenarios where weight sensor may malfunction. 
To minimize this error and enhance reliability, the system could be refined to include a fail-safe dispense logic. 
For example, if a sensor malfunction happens then the system could default to a safe dispensing amount or 
pause operation until human interaction as this would prevent overfeeding or underfeeding. 

Test no.4  
The current logic for checking if food storage is full or not by using the condition not = 0. 
However, this logic is insufficient because it does not consider cases where the remaining food is 
less than the portion size. For instance, if portion size is 25 grams but only 10 grams is left then
the logic will not consider it as a warning because by the condition not = 0, 10 grams is greater than 0 grams.
Therefore, the logic should instead generate a warning when the remaining food in the storage is less than the pre-set portion size.

Test no.8 
Lastly, an improvement would be to display real-time weight changes from the sensor bowl on the screen interface. 
This feature would allow users to verify accurate amount of food is dispensed and provide visibility 
to how much food is left supported by the existing three-beep and 1-beep audio notification system.
